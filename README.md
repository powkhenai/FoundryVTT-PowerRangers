# Power Rangers System

An early start on a system for the Power Rangers RPG by renegade games to be used with the excellent Foundry VTT virtual tabletop.
Currently this is still in-development and incomplete. 
Current project goals are to get a simple logic-less character sheet put together.
Then based on requests from my GM and players I'll fill in parts as I have time.

### ToDo

The remaining items I have for a static character sheet:

- [x] Origin
- [x] Role

- [ ] Power recovery per day
